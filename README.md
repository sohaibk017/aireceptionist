# aireceptionist
This project is about building and offering a done-for-you AI Receptionist Setup Service for local businesses in English-speaking countries (e.g., U.S., Canada, U.K.). The service replaces/reduces the need for a human receptionist by automating tasks like call answering, booking, lead capture, andfollow-ups using AI and workflow automation tools.
